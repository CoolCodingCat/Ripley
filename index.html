            <p>Ellen Ripley was born on January 7, 2092 at the Olympia colony on Luna. After gaining a Masters in engineering from the New York Aeronautics University, she served with the US Merchant Navy aboard the Zelazny, where she acted as co-pilot</p>
            <p>By 2122, Ripley was serving as a warrant officer and third in command aboard the commercial freighter Nostromo. </p>
            <p>Beginning her career as a warrant officer with Weyland-Yutani's commercial freight operations, she was assigned to the USCSS Nostromo in 2122 when it encountered a single Xenomorph unintentionally collected from the planetoid LV-426. The event led to the death of the rest of her crew and the destruction of the ship, and her discovery of the Xenomorph would change the course of her life and plague her for the rest of her existence.</p>
